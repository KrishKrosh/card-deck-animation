# Card Deck Animation

This project demonstrates an interactive 3D card deck animation using React, Three.js, and React Three Fiber.

## Card Back Texture

To customize the back of the cards with an artistic, intricate design:

1. Download a high-quality playing card back texture or create your own
2. Save it as `card-back.png` in the `/public/images/` directory
3. The texture should ideally be square or match the card aspect ratio (7:10)
4. For best results, use a high-resolution image (at least 1024x1024 pixels)

### Recommended Texture Resources

Here are some places where you can find high-quality card back textures:
